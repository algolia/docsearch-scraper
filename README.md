# DocSearch scraper

## DEPRECATED

This repository is not maintained anymore in favor of [our new infrastructure](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/migrating-from-legacy).

You can still use the [run your own](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/legacy/run-your-own) solution, but we won't provide any feature to the DocSearch Scraper.

# Summary

If you're looking for a way to add DocSearch to your site, the easiest solution
is to [apply to DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/apply). To run the scraper yourself, you're at the right
place.

## Installation and Usage

Please check the [dedicated documentation](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/legacy/run-your-own/) to see how you can install and
run DocSearch yourself.

This project supports Python 3.6+
