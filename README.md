# DocSearch scraper

This repository holds the code of the DocSearch crawler used to power the hosted
version of DocSearch.

If you're looking for a way to add DocSearch to your site, the easiest solution
is to [apply to DocSearch][1]. To run the crawler yourself, you're at the right
place.

## Installation and Usage

Please check the [dedicated documentation][2] to see how you can install and
run DocSearch yourself.

This project supports Python 3.6+
